# Stroke_Prediction

## Introduction
Stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. It can lead to serious complications or death. Early prediction of stroke risk can significantly improve patient outcomes. In recent years, machine learning has shown potential in clinical decision support systems. This paper presents a machine learning approach using a healthcare dataset to predict the likelihood of a stroke event.

The following project is based on detecting brain stroke. The project includes the following attributes:
1. Exporing the dataset. Identifying unique values and anomaly.
2. Cleaning the dataset.
3. Outlier detection.
4. Creating new features from existing features.
5. Stroke detection by using KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
6. Result analysis.
